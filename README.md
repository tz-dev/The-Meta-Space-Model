## Project Description

This repository contains the full source and documentation of *‚ÄúThe Meta-Space Model‚Äù* (MSM), an innovative theoretical framework offering a novel ontological and epistemological perspective on the foundations of physics.

Unlike traditional physical models based on dynamics and fields, MSM is founded on eight core postulates (CP1‚ÄìCP8) that specify the necessary structural conditions under which an entropy landscape in a high-dimensional configuration space (*Meta-Space*) can be projected into a real, stable physical world.

The model:

- replaces classical dynamics with projective filters and stability conditions,  
- interprets gravity and interactions as emergent effects of entropic geometry,  
- derives physical constants as emergent invariants of entropy structure,  
- drastically reduces the infinite theory landscape to a discrete, simulatable subset of viable configurations,  
- proposes a new ontology: *reality is what projects stably under entropic constraints.*

## Content and Structure

The book is organized into chapters including:

- Introduction and motivation addressing the epistemic crisis in modern physics,  
- Definition and formal construction of the Meta-Space,  
- Detailed presentation of the eight Core Postulates (CP1‚ÄìCP8) with rigorous mathematical and conceptual explanations,  
- Extended Postulates and specific projection properties,  
- Mathematical models of entropic geometry and their physical interpretation,  
- Projection as a physical principle rather than metaphor,  
- Connection to empirical data and experimental predictions (e.g., LHC, JWST),  
- Philosophical reflections on ontology and epistemology,  
- Glossary and comprehensive appendices on mathematical details and literature references.
