The Meta-Space Model

 - Projective Emergence of Spacetime, Matter, and Constants from a Thermodynamically Structured Over-Geometry -

Modern theoretical physics has seen the emergence of numerous models that extend far beyond empirical verification. String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, and other higher-dimensional frameworks have introduced layers of abstraction without clear experimental validation. These models, while mathematically elegant, often lack testable predictions that would allow them to be conclusively confirmed or falsified.

Moreover, the traditional approach of assuming spacetime, matter, and physical laws as fundamental has led to a fragmentation in the understanding of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Despite significant advances, a unified description that can consistently merge quantum field theory with gravitational dynamics remains elusive.

The Meta-Space Model proposes a novel perspective: instead of assuming the existence of spacetime and fields as fundamental entities, it postulates that these emerge from a deeper, geometrically structured domain called the Meta-Space. In this view, all observable phenomena, including spacetime, matter, and the fundamental constants, are projections from this underlying entropic-geometric substrate.
