# C.1.3 â€“ Export Entropy vs. Meta-Time to CSV
# File: c1_3_generate_entropy_vs_tau_csv.py
# This script reads simulation snapshots (e.g., "entropy_snapshot_100.npy"),
# extracts the average entropy value for each time point (tau),
# and writes the results to a CSV file for further analysis.
# Input:  Files named like "entropy_snapshot_*.npy"
# Output: CSV file "entropy_vs_tau.csv" with columns: tau [s], mean entropy
# =============================================================================
